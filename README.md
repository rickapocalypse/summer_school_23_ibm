### IBM SUMMER SCHOOL 23

Here is a repository for my codes and lessons done during the IBM Summer School event of 2023. In the "lectures" folder, you can find all the PDFs related to important lessons to complete the challenge. The challenges are in the "challenges" folder, separated by labs 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

- Lab 1: It's an introductory challenge that covers the main practical concepts, ranging from vectors and Dirac notation to circuits, delving into a simple application of a Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT).
- Lab 2: This content explores quantum entanglement, addressing specific algorithms such as teleportation and the no-cloning theorem.
- Lab 3: In this challenge, we addressed some algorithms in a simulated manner and using real hardware, such as Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE), Grover's algorithm, and Shor's algorithm to find the period of a function. This activity, besides requesting very interesting algorithms, shows how real hardware can hinder our process of obtaining good results due to the associated hardware errors.
- Lab 4: This lesson was my favorite, as it introduced an algorithm and a concept that I was not familiar with: Iterative Phase Estimation (IPE), which enables something similar to QPE but using fewer qubits through an iterative auxiliary qubit that is reset and rotated depending on the previous result.
- Lab 5: In this activity, numerous error mitigation techniques were applied using Qiskit Runtime.
